  A walkthrough video of the app's capabilities! => https://drive.google.com/file/d/1xeaDGuIfUQXaS0TY0W1b2LDU9Sz1sJcm/view?usp=sharing

  Once you run the 'node server.js' the system will open the main menu

  Here, scroll through the different options to run mysql queries to pull, manipulate, and add data to the queries. 

  If you wish to reset the queries to the original seed data, navigate to the db folder in the terminal. From there, open up mysql, and run a 'SOURCE schema.sql;' and a 
  'SOURCE seeds.sql;' to refresh the data and start with new database.
